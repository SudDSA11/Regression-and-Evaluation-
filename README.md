# Regression-and-Evaluation-
"I applied Simple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict outcomes, visualizing results with plots. To ensure model reliability, I detected and treated multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) method, improving accuracy and interpretability."
